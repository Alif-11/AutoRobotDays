# AutoRobotDays

## Purpose
This repository is more of a Journal, tracking my progress as I attempt to make my own self driving car. The benefit of hosting it on Github is that I can add, modify, and delete any related files and links I want that are related to this 'Journal' of mine. 

I plan to have two major checkpoints in this project.

### Checkpoint 1
The first will revolve around building the [PiCar-V 2.0](https://www.sunfounder.com/products/smart-video-car) and adapting [Sully Chen's Code](https://github.com/SullyChen/Autopilot-TensorFlow) to work with the Sunfounder PiCar-V 2.0 robot, culminating in a self driving car.

I hope to create a small window that will allow me to see the car as it moves autonomously, verifying that it can indeed run on its own.

### Checkpoint 2
The second will revolve around [this Master's paper](https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/64669/706825301-MIT.pdf) as well as [this research article](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.04794.pdf). I hope to be able to create an image of a track using the autonomus driving feature. I then hope to run some of the models from these papers on those digital tracks to create an optimal racing line. I then hope to get my car to follow said racing line, to create an autonomous racing car. 

This second checkpoint is highly ambitious, but is what I am aiming to achieve.

I do not have a specific timeline yet, but I hope to continuously work on this project.
