- I've made this repo, the README and this devlog
- The first two steps to the wheel assembly seem a bit complicated to do while tired at night, so I'll wait until tomorrow morning to do them

- I've completed step 1, which was to complete the wheel assembly of one wheel, of the 27 step user manual to building this car.
- I have began training Sully Chen's code on my MacBook. I'll keep it running as I sleep tonight and I'll check the results tomorrow.
- The MacBook is hot to the touch, and I am scared if I continue training, it will overheat my laptop. I will have to find another way to train Chen's model.

- Forgot to update last night so I'm updating now.
- Tried to train Chen's ML model on my Macbook. Worked until I realized my Macbook might as well have been taking off into the sky with the noises it made and decided to try Google Colab
- Turns out dropping 3 Gigs of images on Google Drive crashes it, so I had to zip it. Turns out unzipping 3 Gigs of images on Google Drive is a hassle, so I ran my gaming laptop all through the night of 8/12 to unzip the images. I am now almost done unzipping 44,000 images (41,000 have been unzipped).

- Finished step 7 of the robot. I finished both wheel assemblies, mounting servos to the camera pan-tilt mechanism, as well as mounting the batteries and battery holder to the main frame of the robot.

- Attached the Raspberry Pi, Raspberry Pi Sunfounder Robot HAT, and Sunfounder Servo controller onto the main frame of the car.
