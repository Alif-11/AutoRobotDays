- I've made this repo, the README and this devlog
- The first two steps to the wheel assembly seem a bit complicated to do while tired at night, so I'll wait until tomorrow morning to do them
- Ahh, sleep sounds so good right about now. I'm thinking about making this into something resembling the blogs I see some manga authors doing. Well, time to brush my teeth and go to bed.
