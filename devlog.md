- I've made this repo, the README and this devlog
- The first two steps to the wheel assembly seem a bit complicated to do while tired at night, so I'll wait until tomorrow morning to do them

- I've completed step 1, which was to complete the wheel assembly of one wheel, of the 27 step user manual to building this car.
- I have began training Sully Chen's code on my MacBook. I'll keep it running as I sleep tonight and I'll check the results tomorrow.
- The MacBook is hot to the touch, and I am scared if I continue training, it will overheat my laptop. I will have to find another way to train Chen's model.
